# Amqpex

Spring AMQP Extensions

This library provides useful extensions and enhancements for Spring AMQP, aiming to simplify common tasks and improve developer experience when working with RabbitMQ in Spring applications.

## Features (Planned/Initial)

*   Facilitate dead-letter-based message retries (useful when server-side configuration is restricted).
*   Provide utilities for advanced connection customization.
*   Offer helper functions for common message handling patterns.

## Development Workflow

This project uses a branching strategy to keep the `master` branch stable for releases.

*   **`master` branch:** Contains the latest stable release.
*   **`develop` branch:** The primary integration branch for new features and fixes.
*   **Feature branches:** Created from `develop` for specific tasks (e.g., `feature/add-retry`, `bugfix/issue-123`), merged back into `develop` via PR.
*   **Releases:** `develop` is merged into `master` when ready for release, followed by a Git tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## TODO (Future Considerations)

*   **Publishing:** Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate building, testing, and publishing artifacts to a repository (Maven Central, JCenter, etc.) upon tagging a release on `master`.
*   **Documentation:** Expand this README with usage examples, API documentation (e.g., generated by Dokka for Kotlin, Javadoc for Java), and detailed guides for each feature.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Define the testing approach (unit, integration, all-in-one tests, Testcontainers if needed later). You mentioned preferring all-in-one tests and H2 for testing, which could be noted here or in CONTRIBUTING.md.
*   **Versioning:** Decide on a versioning scheme (e.g., Semantic Versioning - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
*   **Code Style:** Define or link to a code style guide if necessary (e.g., using EditorConfig, Checkstyle).
*   **Dependencies:** Clearly list minimum required versions of Spring AMQP, Spring Framework, and Java.
